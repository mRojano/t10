Hey there!


app. R /

Contains the main shiny app, all user inputs should go in here, future versions should include the new set of parameters so all can be determined by user.

b1.R /

This script is the core of all the app, all main functions are called from here, DNAWorks program included, the format for the output is made and edit here too. 

writing.R / 
 
 Is the link connecting app.R and b1.R, takes shiny input and connects it to the core script.
 
 List.R /
 
 Weighting equation is here. If you want to modify the number of inputs, and how the general sorting/weighting process will work, this is the script. 
 
 Apologies for the spanglish!
